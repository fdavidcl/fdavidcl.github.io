Some places to visit:

- Carmen de los Mártires: really beautiful and calm park near the Alhambra, you can sometimes see some peacocks and weird birds around there
- Mirador de San Miguel: everyone goes to the Mirador de San Nicolás (it's always full of tourists) but this other one is less well-known, a bit higher up and I like the views even more, you can see the whole city!
- Paseo de los Tristes: it's an iconic street and a great place to walk and take nice selfies with the Alhambra as backdrop, you can get there really easily on foot from Plaza Isabel la Católica (near the Cathedral). There are nice restaurants along the way (Aljibe 1644 and Ruta del Azafrán are good options).
- Calle Alcaicería: it's a really narrow street where you can find lots of handmade souvenirs, leather stuff, some jewelery, all in the typical nazari style. It's near the Bibrambla square and all the touristic places but easy to miss.
- If you have time to spare, you can relax in a hammam (an arabic-style spa), there are several good ones around the city center.
- If you have even more time and you want to see some cute animals, there's the Biodomo at the Parque de las Ciencias.

Places to eat:

- Some of the best tapas are in Plaza Romanilla, also around Calle Varela (e.g. La Pajuana, El Conde and most of the places in those streets). There's a very charming neighborhood near there, Realejo, with nice places too at the Plaza Campo del Príncipe. If you're around the town hall, Calle Navas is also a very typical street to have some tapas.
- There are several really nice restaurants around the old town and in those "houses" called Cármenes (e.g. Carmen Mirador de Aixa/Carmen del Agua). I especially like Jardines Alberto, which does not have the best views but has really tasty arabic dishes (from the "nazari" times when Granada was conquered by the arabs). You *need* to try a "pastela moruna" (a pastry with chicken and nuts), either there or any other place that serves them.
- Go to any of the "Casa Ysla" cafeterias and try the Pionono, it's a dessert that's only made here in Granada; fun fact: it was first made as a celebration for pope Pío IX (aka Pío Noveno or Pio Nono in Spanish) who was visiting Granada.
- Walk through Calle Calderería and visit any of the teterías, they are cozy and they have super nice tea and arabic pastries.
- La esquinita de Javi is a great place to have some fried fish, the specialty of the coast of Granada and Málaga.
- Nice coffee places: Baraka, Mimimi, Minuit, Despiertoo, Kona.

Some other places near Granada: if you have extra time, you can visit Soportújar and Pampaneira (they're super close to each other and just a short bus trip from Granada). The first is a small town with a lot of Studio Ghibli-inspired decorations, and the other one is just a super beautiful town with great viewpoints around.
