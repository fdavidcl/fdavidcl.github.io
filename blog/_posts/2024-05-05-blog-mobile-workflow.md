I wanted to have a more convenient way of adding posts to the blog that didn't involve so much editing, dealing with git, jekyll and everything. Something so that I could just jot down some notes on my phone whenever and have them up in no time. This is what I've found at the moment, I may extend this in the future and feel free to send suggestions my way (talk to me at [dci@c.im](https:// on the fediverse)
