I wanted to have a more convenient way of adding posts to the blog that didn't involve so much editing, dealing with git, jekyll and everything. Something so that I could just jot down some notes on my phone whenever and have them up in no time. This is what I've found at the moment, I may extend this in the future and feel free to send suggestions my way (talk to me at [dci@c.im](https://c.im/@dcl) on the fediverse)

## JekyllEx
An Android app that is supposed to manage Jekyll blogs. Installed it but couldn't get it to launch, it just crashed :(

## isomorphic-git
I didn't find any other promising phone apps and didn't want to deal with developing one myself so I started looking into what tools I would need to write a simple webapp to clone my blog, edit it and send updates. Managing a git repo from the browser seemed daunting but I found this amazing library
